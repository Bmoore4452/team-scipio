                    <p>
                        Anita C. Scipio is a Bronx, America boy turned professional woman. A Jersey graduate from
                        Montclair High School. Anita attended Fairleigh Dickinson University/FIT where she majored in
                        Marketing/Communications and Business. In college she was in the Gospel Choir, Ski club and also
                        involved in other clubs and community events. While studying for her degree business she started
                        to also pursue her passion for music and entertaining as a professional DJ in New Jersey. Her DJ

                        deteriorate because of an injury due to falling during one of her sets. Additionally, due to a
                        health related issue she has decided to pursue a career teaching young adults about DJ culture.

                        Apollo. From her life-long dedication to the world of music, Anita decided to create an
                        interactive hip-hop journal for those who lived and loved this music evolution. An experience to
                        celebrate her achievements and create a place for others to document a time capsule way for
                        everyday music lovers, casual fans, and pro-rappers/aspiring artists to document music and
                        entertainment.
