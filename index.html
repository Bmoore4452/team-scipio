                <p class="dj-subtitle">Hilton V. Scipio, known by his professional name DJ SCIPIO</p>
                <div class="dj-bio">
                    <p>
                        An American Mixtape DJ. He was born and raised in Harlem, N.Y. While
                        growing up, he was intrigued by the soulful sounds of Marvin Gaye,
                        The Stylistics, The Manhattans, The Delfonics, and many others. In
                        1973, right after a fire destroyed the family home, DJ SCIPIO and his
                        family moved to The Bronx, also known as the Boogie Down Bronx.
                        At about that time, the first generation of Hip-Hop was
                        born. With headphones, a mixer, and two Technics
                        turntables, DJ SCIPIO began to experiment with this
                        exciting new music. His first experience with Hip-Hop
                        music included songs such as Apache by Incredible
                        Bongo Band, Mardi Gra by Bob James, and Catch A
                        Hilton V. Scipio, p.k.a DJ SCIPIO
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Grove by Juice. He was influenced by DJs such as Kool Herc,
                        GrandMaster Flash, and Grand Wizard Theodore. DJ SCIPIO
                        credits his good friend, Greg Simpkins, p.k.a. DJ Jazzy G, as
                        one of his first Hip-Hop influencers. DJ SCIPIO was also
                        influenced by his brother, Stanley Scipio, p.k.a. DJ KFD, who
                        was also a Disco, Soul, and Funk DJ. DJ SCIPIO influenced the
                        DJ’ing career of his nephew Kevin Bush, p.k.a. DJ Cool Kev,
                        now the Founder and CEO of Steady Breezing Entertainment.
                        Eventually, DJ SCIPIO went on to play at several clubs and
                        house parties. In 1989, DJ SCIPIO left N.Y.C. and moved to
                        Orangeburg, S.C.
                        There, he discovered that he had a real niche in the music of
                        the South. With an ear for the hottest Dirty South Music, he
                        quickly built his reputation with street-level rap music. He
                        soon became a household name across The Carolinas and
                        beyond. He incorporated other genres of music, such as West
                        Coast and Southern Soul. He kept his ears to the streets,
                        breaking records for major and local artists. Many N.Y.C.
                        Mixtape stores and vendors credit him for being among the
                        first DJs to bring Dirty South mixtapes to N.Y. He quickly
                        climbed the ranks and soon received exclusive freestyles,
                        shoutouts from major labels, artists, radio stations, and
                        mixtape awards. DJ Scipio has received over twenty awards,
                        including five consecutive awards for Mixtape DJ of the Year
                        in South Carolina. DJ SCIPIO continues to be instrumental in
                        the entertainment and music industry.
